LiteMySQL 1.2
-----------------------------------
Date: 4-Mar-2010

- Fixed two SQL-inject issues.

- Fixed an issue with using the
  primary-key option.

- Fixed limit and offset options so
  limit is usable without offset.

- find_all() returns an empty array if
  no records match conditions.

- Conditions can now look for multiple
  matching values.

  For Example:
  find_all(array('id' => array(1,3)))

  Will create a WHERE statement that
  looks like:
  WHERE `id` IN(1,3)

LiteMySQL 1.1.2
-----------------------------------
Date: 25-May-2009

- Using $sql->columns to get the list of
  table columns should now always work.

- Added an increment() method to easily
  bump a column's integer value up by 1,
  or any value you specify.

-----------------------------------


LiteMySQL 1.1.1
-----------------------------------
Date: 25-May-2009

- Changed the find_all() method now
  returns null instead of false if no
  rows are returned. This is so that you
  can run the result through count(), which
  evals false to 1, and null to 0.

- Changed the count() method to return
  an integer with the count value rather
  than a string.

-----------------------------------


LiteMySQL 1.1
-----------------------------------
Date: 21-May-2009

- Added a count() method which simply
  counts the number of records matching
  the given conditions.

- Added primary_key support so you can
  specify a custom primary key, rather
  than defaulting to the "id" column.

- Added last_insert_id property containing
  the primary_key value from the last
  insert.

- Added support for specifying connection
  encoding. Defaults to "utf8".

- The "order_by" option is now called
  "order" for reasons of sanity.

- Connection resources no longer collide
  between multiple instances of the
  LiteMySQL class. Currently connection
  resources are not reused at all. It's
  a temporary fix for now.

- Fixed a few small bugs.

LiteMySQL 1.0.2
-----------------------------------
Date: 16-Dec-2007

- Fixed an issue which made using the same
  instance of LiteMySQL not play very nice
  at all when used with multiple tables.
  use the select_table() function to
  select and/or change the current table.

- find(), update(), and delete() functions
  default to only effect one row (LIMIT 1).
  This should be configurable with the 
  options parameter, but thanks to some
  stupid code on my behalf, it was simply
  overridden if it was set manually.

- load_settings() function can now take a
  filename with a configuration array, or
  an array with the settings directly as
  input. Rather than only being able to
  load settings from a file.

-----------------------------------


LiteMySQL 1.0.1
-----------------------------------
Date: 14-Dec-2007

- Fixed an issue with conditions building
  which didn't properly escape special
  characters, leaving yourself open to
  remote SQL injection if passing direct
  user-input into a condition.

LiteMySQL 1.0
-----------------------------------
Date: 13-Dec-2007

- Initial release
