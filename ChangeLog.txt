LiteMySQL 1.0.2
-----------------------------------
Date: 16-Dec-2007

- Fixed an issue which made using the same
  instance of LiteMySQL not play very nice
  at all when used with multiple tables.
  use the select_table() function to
  select and/or change the current table.

- find(), update(), and delete() functions
  default to only effect one row (LIMIT 1).
  This should be configurable with the 
  options parameter, but thanks to some
  stupid code on my behalf, it was simply
  overridden if it was set manually.

- load_settings() function can now take a
  filename with a configuration array, or
  an array with the settings directly as
  input. Rather than only being able to
  load settings from a file.

LiteMySQL 1.0.1
-----------------------------------
Date: 14-Dec-2007

- Fixed an issue with conditions building
  which didn't properly escape special
  characters, leaving yourself open to
  remote SQL injection if passing direct
  user-input into a condition.
